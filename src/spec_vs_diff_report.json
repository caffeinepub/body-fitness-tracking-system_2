  "summary": "The implementation uses React with TypeScript and Motoko backend as specified, but several key requirements are missing or incomplete. The BuildRequest specified Chart.js should NOT be used, yet REQ-3 explicitly requires Chart.js for weekly progress chart. The implementation uses custom SVG visualization instead, which contradicts the requirement. The implementation stores data in the Motoko backend actor correctly. However, multiple navigation pages (Features, About, Contact) lack complete implementations in the truncated diff. Dark mode toggle and several UI requirements appear implemented correctly.",
